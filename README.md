# Ricket

## What is Ricket?

Ricket is an attempt to open up the WASI platform to the Plan 9 OS, and hopefully allow more software to be used on Plan 9 with little cost to the developer.

Ricket is a frontend and toolset for [wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero) tailored specifically for use with Plan 9.

## Project status

Currently it's experimental.

## Project goals

- [x] Be able to run WASI programs at all
- [X] Be able to run WASI programs on Plan 9
